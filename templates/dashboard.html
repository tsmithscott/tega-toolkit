                <p class="text-dark">Games, however, do not only differ in short-term game mechanics (micro mechanics), but also in long-term mechanics (macro mechanics). The latter motivate for hours, if not for days and weeks. Often progression strategies or intrinsic narrative strategies are used as macro mechanics, such as, in form of new (visual) worlds, additional new challenges, superordinate comparisons, and (complex) stories.</p>
                <p class="text-dark">For example, the game Tearaway (2013) is visually and narratively convincing with its unique unfolding paper world. If we now classify the rules according to the well-known Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics (MDA) theory (cf. Hunicke et al. 2004), which attempts to formalize the consumption of games by means of analytics, and in which mechanics are the basic components/ rules (possible player actions, algorithms etc.) of a game.</p>

                <p class="text-dark">Sorting, exploring, and storytelling are examples of macro mechanics. Often storytelling is accompanied by a second macro mechanic such as exploring that is key for setting up sets of supporting micro mechanics. Developers often view storytelling as a method to structure games in plot sequences and purvey meaning. However, meaning can also be purveyed by motivational game mechanics.</p>
